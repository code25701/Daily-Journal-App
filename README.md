# Daily-Journal-App
Peliah Wendt.
 I'm trying to build a daily journal app. 
 It will be used for people to journal about their day so that they can remember how the day went.
 I will use a class with multiple methods allowing for removing, adding, and viewing of journal entries.
 This project will require a lot of effort to figure out some aspects that I am still unsure of.
 I will have to work on making the interface user friendly.
 To use: select the option you would like to do. Follow the instructions that follow. To remove or view an entry, type the number of the entry minus 1
