# Daily-Journal-App
Peliah Wendt
I'm trying to build a daily journal app
It will be used for people to journal about their day so that they can remember how the day went
I will use a class with multiple methods allowing for removing, adding, and viewing of journal entries
This project will require a lot of effort to figure out some aspects that I am still unsure of
I will have to work on making the interface user friendly
